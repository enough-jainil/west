# Ghost Code: Underwater Trash Detection and Water Quality Assessment

Ghost Code presents an innovative solution to combat underwater pollution and assess water quality. Our project offers three key components: real-time trash detection using YOLO, a rule-based classifier for aquatic habitat assessment, and a machine learning model for water potability classification.

## The Spectral Team

- Jainil Prajapati (Leader of the Apparitions)
- Smit Prajapati (Phantom Developer)
- Shrey Pathak (Specter of Data)
- Priya Parmar (Wraith of Algorithms)

## Summoning the Code

To conjure this project on your local machine, follow these mystical steps:

1. Clone the ethereal repository to your mortal realm.
2. Invoke the installation of requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Awaken the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   new_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Materialize the application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main_app.py
   ```

## Supernatural Features

- Detect underwater specters (trash) in real-time using input images.
- Divine water quality as potable or non-potable based on arcane chemical properties.
- Determine if water is a suitable habitat for aquatic spirits.

## Arcane Tech Stack

- Python (The Serpent's Tongue)
- YOLOv8 (Eye of the Beholder)
- XGBoost Classifier (The Ethereal Predictor)
- Streamlit (Portal to the Mortal Realm)
